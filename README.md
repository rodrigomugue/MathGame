This is a college project where I demonstrated the basic knowledge of programming in the first semester.\
It is a calculator/game for math students with the six basic operations (addition, substraction, 
multiplication, division, root and exponent). It lets the user enter the operation type and two numbers 
to calculate with or, to do timed exercises of the operation of chose until they get it right and choose to stop.
